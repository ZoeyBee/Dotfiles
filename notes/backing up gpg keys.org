To backup your secret keys:

gpg -a --export-secret-keys > secret.asc
This will actually put all of your secret keys in a single file.

For your public keys:

gpg -a --export > public.asc
You also need your trust database:

gpg -a --export-ownertrust > trust.asc
To restore your keys:

gpg --import public.asc secret.asc

gpg --import-ownertrust trust.asc
